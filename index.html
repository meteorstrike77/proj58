      <h1>My Hobby: Reading Books</h1>

      <p>One of my favorite hobbies is to read books. Reading books is fun because it is a great way to expand your knowledge. Non-fiction books are a type of book that focuses on real things. For example, a book about frogs would be a non-fiction book. These books help me learn facts about things that I might've never thought about.</p>
      <p>Another reason why I like books is that aside from facts, they can be very interesting and an escape from the real world. A fiction book is a type of book which focuses on something that does not exist. There are many different types of fiction. For example, realistic fiction focuses on a situation that could be possible in the real world. Historical fiction focuses on fiction related to a real historical event. Science fiction focuses on futuristic things like space. The variety of fiction books will get you interested in reading them.
      <p>To conclude, reading is a fun hobby which can entertain you and also inform you about many different topics. It can help you take a break from the real world. Reading can be very exciting, especially fiction with its plot. Do you also enjoy to read?
